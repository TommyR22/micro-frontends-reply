# Client-side Composition

Team Checkout chose to go with client-side rendering for their user interfaces.
Theyâ€™ve implemented the checkout pages as a single page app (SPA). The Buy-button
fragment is available as a standalone Web Component. Same for team Inspire.

## Benefits
* web Components is a web standard
* shadow DOM and custom elements

## The drawbacks
* require client-side javascript
* no SSR
